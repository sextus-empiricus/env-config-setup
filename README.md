### Comments
* For some reason nest-compiler is changing`./dist` folder structure and place the application files into `./dist/src` folder.
* Because of mentioned above its necessary to change `start:prod` script.
* It's required to add `"outDir": "dist/src"` to `nest-cli.json` file to keep the `config` folder structure and get
  the `.env` files by `getEnvPatch()` function without modification.
```json
  "compilerOptions": {
    "assets": [
      {
        "include": "config/envs/*",
        "outDir": "dist/src"
      }
```
